This is a list of desired lidar features:

>>Variable to filter out min and max angles
     --This will help with how many beds to count
     
>>Visual screen that shows laser line and updates with slider for min and max angles 
     --Would be much easier to set min and max angles to have live data from the lidar
     
>>Option to find the beds or the furrows
     --If lidar is used on beds with plants already growing it might be better to follow the furrow then the bed. Missing plants or uneven
     planting could cause false edges.
